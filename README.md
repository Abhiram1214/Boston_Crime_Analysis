# Boston_Crime_Analysis


Objective: To analyze the data and find patterns about the crimes commited in Boston. This project will give insights into types of crimes commited in various parts of the city. 

Client: City Of Boston.

Data anlysis will help the city of Boston to identify various crimes happening across the city. Based on our analysis, they can identify the frequency of each crime and the areas/streets that they took place.

By exploring the data, we can find specific details of a crime and take necessary steps to prevent it from happening in the future.

Data: I am using the Boston Crime dataset from Kaggle.

Approach: 

    • I will explore the data and see if there are any null values in the columns.
    
    • Determine if the null values affect the outcome of the project and take necessary steps to address them accordingly.
    
    • I will determine the type of crimes occured between 2015 – 2018 and see if there is a pattern to the crimes.
    
    • I will try and find out which day of the week has the highest crime rate and see if the crimes occur during the day or   the night.
    
    • Idnetify the top crimes that occur in the city and find the areas affected by them.
    
    • Conclude the project by summarizing my findings.
